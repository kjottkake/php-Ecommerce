    // Implement registration functionality instead, if a register hyperlink is clicked. 
    
    // HINT : You can toggle between login form or registration form on the same page, based on whether the register link was clicked or not. The login form should have a button to switch to the register form, while the register form should have a button switching back to the login form.
